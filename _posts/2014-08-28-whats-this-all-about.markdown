This is my way of keeping up to date with journaling the progress of training my dog.
It's really that simple.


## Why Journal About a Dog?

This has actually been prescribed to me (and I have slacked off for two weeks), by Walker's behaviorist.
Walker suffers from extreme separation anxiety.
It has gotten so bad to the point that he barks to the point that I receive noise complaints.
What makes things worse is that he licks and bites the bars of his crate until he bleeds.
On top of this, he drools and pees in his crate when left.

So this is a journey of being really transparent each week with how our training is coming along.
I want to share this so that others can learn.

These are also the same posts that I will send each week to Walker's behaviorist.
